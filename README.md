## üìù Description
We are about to deploy an ML model for car selling price prediction and analysis. This kind of system becomes handy for many people.

Imagine a situation where you have an old car and want to sell it. You may of course approach an agent for this and find the market price, but later may have to pay pocket money for his service in selling your car. But what if you can know your car selling price without the intervention of an agent. Or if you are an agent, definitely this will make your work easier. Yes, this system has already learned about previous selling prices over years of various cars.

So, to be clear, this deployed web application will provide you will the approximate selling price for your car based on the fuel type, years of service, showroom price, the number of previous owners, kilometres driven, if dealer/individual, and finally if the transmission type is manual/automatic. And that‚Äôs a brownie point.

Any kind of modifications can also be later inbuilt in this application. It is only possible to later make a facility to find out buyers. This a good idea for a great project you can try out. You can deploy this as an app like OLA or any e-commerce app. The applications of Machine Learning don‚Äôt end here. Similarly, there are infinite possibilities that you can explore. But for the time being, let me help you with building the model for Car Price Prediction and its deployment process.
